# Traffic-Rule-Violation-Detection-System

This project tries to detect a car whenever it crosses a Red Light or overspeeds. It uses tensorflow with an ssd object detection model to detect cars and from the detections in each frame each vehicle can be tracked across a video and can be checked if it crossed a redlight and speed of that vehicle can be calculated.
